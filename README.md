# Titanic Survival Prediction (End-to-End Machine Learning Project)

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
Kaggle Titanic Dataset

## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical features
   - Removed unnecessary columns

2. Feature Engineering
   - Converted categorical variables into numeric form
   - Created final modeling dataset

3. Models Trained
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest

4. Model Evaluation
   - Accuracy
   - Precision & Recall
   - ROC-AUC
   - Confusion Matrix

5. Hyperparameter Tuning
   - Tuned Random Forest depth and number of trees
   - Compared generalization performance

## Final Result
Random Forest achieved the best balance between accuracy and generalization.

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
